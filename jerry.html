<h1 id="gang"> Community effect of gang violence</h1>

<p id="gang">Gangs increase the levels of crimes in communities, and set a bad example for kids in the area. They create an image of power and respect, when in reality they drop out of school, struggle with unemployment, abuse drugs and alcohol or end up in jail. Communities fear them because of the harm they can bring to others.</p>

<p id="gang">This study of gang members' criminal activity considers the general community impact,
     violent gang criminal activity, gang members returning from prison,
      gang migration and immigration, gangs in schools, and the economic impact of gangs.
    For these areas, the impact of youth gang activities encompasses the intimidation of other youth, adults, witnesses, and business owners.
    Gang immigration may be a factor of greater importance than gang migration in the impact of outsiders on local gangs.
     Gangs in schools are likely underestimated. Generally, law enforcement agencies tend to under-report gang incidents,
     and their estimates of the number of gangs and gang members are likely to omit a substantial number of students.
     Gangs tend to influence youth to become career criminals whose lives involve multiple arrests, convictions,
     and periods of incarceration. A single adolescent criminal career of about 10 years can cost taxpayers between $1.7 and $2.3 million.
     The Comprehensive Gang Prevention, Intervention, and Suppression Model (Spergel, 1995) is a flexible framework that guides communities
    in developing and implementing a continuum of programs and strategies for countering the adverse impact of youth gangs. 49 references</p>
