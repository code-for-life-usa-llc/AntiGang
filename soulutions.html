<h1>Solutions To Gun Violence</h1>
<h3>How Can We Help</h3>
<img src="67.png" height="155px" width="200px" >
<p>It goes beyond the mass shootings that grab the nation’s attention. Every day, gun violence takes lives from communities all across the country in the form of suicides, unintentional shootings, and interpersonal conflicts that become fatal due to easy access to guns.

    In this country, an average of 35,000 people are killed with guns every year—96 each day.
    
    Yet this violence is not inevitable. Every other developed nation in the world does a better job of protecting its people from gun violence. The gun murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher than it is in peer nations, and American teenagers are 82 times more likely to die from a gun homicide than their international peers.</p>
